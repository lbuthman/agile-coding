- hiding implementation is about abstraction. A class does not simply push its variables out through getters and setters,
rather, it exposes abstract interfaces that allow its uses to manipulate the essence of the data without knowning its
implementation

- we do not want to expose the details of our data

- objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data. Data structures expose their
data and have no meaningful functions
