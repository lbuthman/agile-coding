- hiding implementation is about abstraction. A class does not simply push its variables out through getters and setters,
rather, it exposes abstract interfaces that allow its uses to manipulate the essence of the data without knowning its
implementation

- we do not want to expose the details of our data

- objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data. Data structures expose their
data and have no meaningful functions

- Law of Demeter -> a method f() of a class C should only call
  1) methods of C
  2) an object created by f()
  3) an object passed as an argument to f()
  4) an object held in an instance variable of C

- DTO -> Data Transfer Object
  - a quintessential form of a data structure, a class with public variables and no functions
  - very useful when communicating with databases or parsing messages from sockets

- Active Records
  - special forms of DTOs, they have public variables and navigational methods like save() and find()
  - be careful of adding Business Rules to these objects as it is not appropriate
