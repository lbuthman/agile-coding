Simple Rules for Creating Good Names

- use intention-revealing names 
  -- a name should answer all the big questions: why it exists, what it does, how it's used
  -- choose a name that specifies what is being measured and the unit of measurement
  
- avoid disinformation
  -- as an example, do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an accountList unless it's actually a List data type,
  instead prefer accountGroups or accounts. Even if it is a List the latter is still better

- make meaningful distinctions
  -- if names must be different, then they should mean something different as well
  
- use pronouncable names
  -- programming is a social activity, so use names you can pronounce so that you can talk about them easily
  
- use searchable names
  -- single letter names are not easy to locate across a body of text, use them only as local variables inside
  short methods
  -- the length of a name should correspond to the size of its scope

- avoid encoding
  -- encoding type or scope information into names simply adds an extra burden of deciphering
  
-- avoid mental mappings
  -- reader's shouldn't have to mentally translate your names into other names they already know. This problem
  generally arises from a choice to use neither problem domain terms nor solution domain terms
  -- one difference between smart programmers and professional programmers is that the professionals understand
  that clarity is king
  
- pick one word per concept
  -- it's confusing to have fetch, retrieve, and get as equivalent methods of different classes
