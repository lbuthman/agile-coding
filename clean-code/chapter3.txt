Rules for Functions

- be small
  -- lines should be <= 150 characters, functions should be <= 20 lines but preferrably 4 lines long
  -- blocks within if, else, and while statements should be one line long, usually a function call
  
- do one thing
  -- Functions should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only.
  -- the function is doing one thing if you can't extract another function from it without merely restating the
  name of its implementation
  
- one level of abstraction per function
  -- watch for concepts at different levels creeping into a function, from a high level of accessing a resource
  to a low level of manipulation

- reading code from top to bottom
  -- we want to read the program as though it were a set of TO paragraphs, each of which is describing the current
  level of abstraction and referencing subsequent TO paragraphs at the next level down.
  -- I think this will be aptly applied to deeper dives of pseudo code.
  
- switch statements
  -- bury each switch statement in a low level class so that it is never repeated
  -- to do this, use an Abstract Factory Pattern that hides the switch behind inheritance

- use descriptive names
  -- "You know you are working on clean code when each routine turns out to be pretty much what you expected."
  -- a long descriptive name is better than a short enigmatic one
  
- function arguments
  -- zero is best, then one, followed closely by two, more than that needs to be justified but maybe not used
  at all
  -- arguments require interpretation by the reader
  -- more challenging for testing, each additional argument can create many variations to test
  
- common monadic forms
  1) ask a question about the argument
  2) transforming it is returning the transformed object
  3) an event, that alters the system state but doesn't return anything
  -- try to avoid monadic functions that don't follow these forms. Using an output argument instead of a return
  value for a transformation is confusing
  
- flag argument
  -- passing a boolean into a function is a bad practice because this funciton can now do one of two things, one
  if true and one if false
  -- split the function, one for each case
  
- dyadic functions
  -- the parts of code we ignore are the parts where bugs hide
