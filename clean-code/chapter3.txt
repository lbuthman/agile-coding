Rules for Functions

- be small
  -- lines should be <= 150 characters, functions should be <= 20 lines but preferrably 4 lines long
  -- blocks within if, else, and while statements should be one line long, usually a function call
  
- do one thing
  -- Functions should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only.
  -- the function is doing one thing if you can't extract another function from it without merely restating the
  name of its implementation
  
- one level of abstraction per function
  -- watch for concepts at different levels creeping into a function, from a high level of accessing a resource
  to a low level of manipulation

- reading code from top to bottom
  -- we want to read the program as though it were a set of TO paragraphs, each of which is describing the current
  level of abstraction and referencing subsequent TO paragraphs at the next level down.
  -- I think this will be aptly applied to deeper dives of pseudo code.
  
- switch statements
  -- bury each switch statement in a low level class so that it is never repeated
  -- to do this, use an Abstract Factory Pattern that hides the switch behind inheritance
