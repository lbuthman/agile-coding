- comments are failures, failures to express ourselves in code

- programmers can't realistically maintain comments, thus falling into a state of disinformation

- rather than spend time explaining cluttered and complex code, explaining the mess you made, spend the time cleaning it

- in many cases, it's as simple as creating a function that says what you would say in a comment

- a useful comment can explain the intent of the function
